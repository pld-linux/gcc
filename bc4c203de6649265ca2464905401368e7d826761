  [2.7.2.3-16]
- now gcc 2.7.2.3 for backward compatybility for proper
  compiling kernel 2.0.x is compiled like cross compilator
  (remember use "CC=<arch>-linux-gcc" as make parameter during
  compile kernel),
- removed gcc man and inbfo page (this can be provided by egcs).

* Sun Sep 27 1998 Tomasz K³oczko <kloczek@rudy.mif.pg.gda.pl>

* Mon Jul 13 1998 Jeff Johnson <jbj@redhat.com>

- use extensively CFLAGS="-O2" when building the compiler (this is known to
  help the fully compatible Cyrix chips (sic!) to run this beast)

- better yet, ExclusiveArch: i386 is in effect

- removed the c++ package as we are swhiching to egcs-c++

  it for this time

- added patch from rth to fix dump on alpha w/ building libg++

* Sun Sep 28 1997 Erik Troan <ewt@redhat.com>
- djb really made the crtbegin/end stuff in gcc-c-skel conditional on
  running on an i386 machine, not a !sparc machine; all changed was his
  comment
- added patch to use /lib/ld-linux.so.2 on the alpha

* Tue Sep 23 1997 Richard Henderson <rth@cygnus.com>
- Killed the glibc.patch and added sparc.patch2 to _really_ make
  libgcc.a be compiled with -fPIC.

* Fri Sep 19 1997 Donald Barnes <djb@redhat.com>
